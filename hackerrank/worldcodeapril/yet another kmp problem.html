his challenge uses the famous KMP algorithm. It isn't really important to understand how KMP works, but you should understand what it calculates.

A KMP algorithm takes a string, SS, of length NN as input. Let's assume that the characters in SS are indexed from 11 to NN; for every prefix of SS, the algorithm calculates the length of its longest valid border in linear complexity. In other words, for every ii (where 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N) it calculates the largest ll (where 0≤l≤i−10≤l≤i−1) such that for every pp (where 1≤p≤l1≤p≤l) there is S[p]=S[i−l+p]S[p]=S[i−l+p].

Here is an implementation example of KMP:

kmp[1] = 0;
for (i = 2; i <= N; i = i + 1){
l = kmp[i - 1];
while (l > 0 && S[i] != S[l + 1]){
l = kmp[l];
}
if (S[i] == S[l + 1]){
kmp[i] = l + 1;
}
else{
kmp[i] = 0;
}
}
Given a sequence x1,x2,…,x26x1,x2,…,x26, construct a string, SS, that meets the following conditions:

The frequency of letter 'aa' in SS is exactly x1x1, the frequency of letter 'bb' in SS is exactly x2x2, and so on.
Let's assume characters of SS are numbered from 11 to NN, where ∑i=1nxi=N∑i=1nxi=N. We apply the KMP algorithm to SS and get a table, kmpkmp, of size NN. You must ensure that the sum of kmp[i]kmp[i] for all ii is minimal.
If there are multiple strings which fulfill the above conditions, print the lexicographically smallest one.

Input Format

A single line containing 2626 space-separated integers describing sequence xx.

Constraints

The sum of all xixi will be a positive integer ≤106≤106.
Output Format

Print a single string denoting SS.

Sample Input

2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Sample Output

aabb
Explanation

The output string must have two 'aa' and two 'bb'. There are several such strings but we must ensure that sum of kmp[i]kmp[i] for all 1<=i<=41<=i<=4 is minimal. See the figure below:

The minimum sum is 11. Among all the strings that satisfy both the condition, "aabb" is the lexicographically smallest.
